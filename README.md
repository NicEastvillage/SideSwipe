# SideSwipe

Rocket League SideSwipe is Psyonix' mobile port of Rocket League. This script will emulate SideSwipe using the [RLBot framework](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot) by forcing all players and the ball onto the YZ-plane. It is recommended to use the mutator Boost Amount: Recharge (fast) due to the lack of boost pads in the middle. Supports up to 5v5.
